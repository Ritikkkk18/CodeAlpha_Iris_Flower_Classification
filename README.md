# CodeAlpha_Iris_Flower_Classification
Iris Flower Species Prediction project developed during the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship to classify Iris flowers using machine learning and deploy the model through an interactive Streamlit application.
# 🌸 Iris Flower Species Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **machine learning classification system** that predicts the **species of an Iris flower** based on its physical measurements.  
An interactive **Streamlit web application** allows users to input flower measurements and instantly receive the predicted species along with prediction confidence.

This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Identifying the species of an Iris flower manually can be difficult without botanical expertise.  
The objective of this project is to:
- Build a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species  
- Use flower measurements as input features  
- Provide a simple and interactive prediction interface
